# Yandex-Music-Discord-Rich-Presence
The program currently has many disadvantages:

1. If you HAVE ALREADY STARTED LISTENING TO THE TRACK, and then opened it, then RPC will give a false time

2. RPC may lag behind reality

3. Large size due to WindowsSDK.NET.dll

4. Sometimes track images are not displayed correctly (for example, an image of another track is shown)

5. There is no button with a link to the track \ artist \ album, etc., only on Yandex Music

6. There is no interface, only a tray icon with a context menu with 3 items

7. Unable to configure RPC localization


How to use the program:

1. Download Setup(your configuration, ARM is not supported)

2. Open it and install the application at your convenient location

3. Open the icon that appears on the desktop

4. Look in the tray [in the taskbar there are small icons on the bottom right]

5. Find the Discord icon there [blue] and click PCM

6. Select the items you need from the context menu

The program currently has the following disadvantages:

1. RPC may lag behind reality

2. Large size due to WindowsSDK.NET.dll

3. Sometimes track images are not displayed correctly (for example, an image of another track is shown)


How to use the program:

1. Download Setup(your configuration, ARM is not supported)

2. Open it and install the application at your convenient location

3. Open the icon that appears on the desktop

4. That's it, you can use the program!

How to delete a program:

1. Open Windows Settings

2. Select Apps

3. Find and select YandexMusicRPC

4. Click on the context menu to the right of the program name and select delete

5. That's done, but if you have enabled AutoStart, then you may still have a file for autorun! To delete it, go to C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup and delete the ymRPC_AutoStart.cmd file
